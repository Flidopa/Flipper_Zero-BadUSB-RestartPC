A bad USB script for Flipper Zero that shuts down a victim's computer by scaring them with a joke.

# What's the point?
Many scripts are done as a prank. In the beginning, the victim is frightened by unexpected actions, for example, the text "You've been hacked haha!" 
And then a reboot of the computer is performed, which finally scares your victim   (｀∀´)Ψ
