A bad USB script for Flipper Zero that shuts down a victim's computer by scaring them with a joke.

# What's the point?
Many scripts are done as a prank. In the beginning, the victim is frightened by unexpected actions, for example, the text "You've been hacked hahahaha!" 
And then a reboot of the computer is performed, which finally scares your victim (｀∀´)Ψ

# Does it harm the victim's computer?
No, it doesn't do much damage. But everything that has been opened on the victim's computer will most likely not be saved, i.e. it resets all progress in Word, for example.

# Does it harm my flipper?
I suggest disabling your flipper as soon as a reboot message appears on your computer screen.
