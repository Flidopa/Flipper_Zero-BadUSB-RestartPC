A bad USB script for Flipper Zero that shuts down a victim's computer by scaring them with a joke.

# What's the point?
Many scripts are done as a prank. In the beginning, the victim is frightened by unexpected actions, for example, the text "You've been hacked hahahaha!" 
And then a reboot of the computer is performed, which finally scares your victim (｀∀´)Ψ

# Does it harm the victim's computer?
No, it doesn't do much damage. But everything that has been opened on the victim's computer will most likely not be saved, i.e. it resets all progress in Word, for example.

# Does it harm my flipper?
I suggest disabling your flipper as soon as a reboot message appears on your computer screen.

# ➤➤➤ What does each script do?
+ Restart_PC.txt - Just opens cmd and shuts down the computer.
+ Restart_PC_Hack.txt - This script opens notepad and writes in large text "NICE HACK BRO" and then "SAY GOODBYE TO THE PC!". Then it opens cmd and shuts down the computer.
+ Love_Hack.txt - This script opens a notepad and draws a syringe with text and the text " YOU ( ≖‿ ≖ ) HAVE (づ｡ ◕‿‿◕｡)づ BEEN (⺣◡⺣)♡* HACKED ( ︶︿︶)_╭∩╮༘⋆♡⸝⸝⊹。°˖➴LOVE!!!!  /ᐠ. ｡.ᐟ\ᵐᵉᵒʷˎˊ˗"
And finally using cmd to shut down the computer.
+ Bsod_Restart.txt - A fake BSOD opens and then the computer reboots.

# Will there be more new scripts to come?
Probably yes, if I get new ideas. ¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯
